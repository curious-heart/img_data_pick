# img_data_pick

If you have a curve figure, maybe you want to get the function/equation of the curve, so that you can get any data of point on the curve. This tool may help you:

Import the curve-figure-image, set the axis datum, select enough points on the curve, and the tool can generate a fitted function which can calculate any data (x) you input.

The tool is still in development, and we will try our best to optimize it...
